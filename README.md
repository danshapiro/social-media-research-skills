# Social Media Research Skills for AI Agents

Practical AI agent skills for social media research, powered by [ScrapeCreators](https://scrapecreators.com).

These skills help agents find outlier posts, mine comments, summarize transcripts, tear down competitors, analyze ad libraries, and turn public social data into useful business artifacts.

This is not just endpoint routing. The goal is to give your AI agent complete research workflows it can run across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest, Rumble, ad libraries, and more.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add ScrapeCreators/social-media-research-skills
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, VS Code, and other agents that support the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## Setup

Set your ScrapeCreators API key:

```bash
export SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY=sk_...
```

The workflow skills should use `scrapecreators-api` as the data layer when they need endpoint details. Each workflow produces a useful artifact, not just raw JSON.

## Design Principles

1. **Workflow-first, API-second** — users ask for a business outcome, not an endpoint.
2. **Public-data only** — ScrapeCreators extracts public social data. Do not promise logged-in/private data.
3. **Cited outputs** — include source URLs for posts, videos, ads, and comments whenever possible.
4. **Baseline-aware analysis** — judge performance against a creator's own normal performance, not only raw vanity metrics.
5. **Exact language matters** — preserve useful comments, hooks, captions, and transcript quotes verbatim.
6. **Keep outputs actionable** — end with patterns, recommendations, test ideas, or a CSV when useful.
